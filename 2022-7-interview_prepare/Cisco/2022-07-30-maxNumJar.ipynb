    "There is a set of N Jars. The jars contain differing numbers of chocolates. Some of the jars may be empty. Andrew may pick multiple jars but he may not pick any jar that is adjacent to a jar that he has already picked.\n",

    "Input: The first line of the input consists of an integer- choco_size, representing the number of jars of chocolates(N). The second line of the input consists of N space-separated integers- choco, representing the number of chocolates in each jar.\n",
