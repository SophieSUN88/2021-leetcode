    "### 6133. Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition My SubmissionsBack to Contest\n",

    "You are given a positive integer array grades which represents the grades of students in a university. You would like to enter all these students into a competition in ordered non-empty groups, such that the ordering meets the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the grades of students in the ith group is less than the sum of the grades of students in the (i + 1)th group, for all groups (except the last).\n",
    "The total number of students in the ith group is less than the total number of students in the (i + 1)th group, for all groups (except the last).\n",
    "Return the maximum number of groups that can be formed.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: grades = [10,6,12,7,3,5]\n",

    "Explanation: The following is a possible way to form 3 groups of students:\n",
    "- 1st group has the students with grades = [12]. Sum of grades: 12. Student count: 1\n",
    "- 2nd group has the students with grades = [6,7]. Sum of grades: 6 + 7 = 13. Student count: 2\n",
    "- 3rd group has the students with grades = [10,3,5]. Sum of grades: 10 + 3 + 5 = 18. Student count: 3\n",
    "It can be shown that it is not possible to form more than 3 groups.\n",
