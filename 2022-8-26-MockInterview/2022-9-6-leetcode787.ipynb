    "\n",
    "We have a dedicated start and endpoint. We have a bunch of choices for each node in the form of its neighbors. And, we want to minimize the overall shortest distance from the source to the destination which can be represented as a recursive structure in terms of shortest distances of its neighbors to the destination. So, we can apply a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with any recursive approach, we need to figure out the state of recursion. There are two parameters here which will control our recursion. One is obviously the node itself. The other is the number of steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We'll define a function called recurse which will take two inputs: node and stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We'll also define a dictionary memo of tuples that will store the optimal solution for each recursion state encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. At each stage, we'll first check if we have reached the destination or not. If we have, then no more moves have to be made and we return a value of 0 since the destination is at a zero distance from itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Next, we check if we have any more stops left. If we don't then we return inf basically representing that we cannot reach the destination from the current recursion state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, we check if the current recursion state is cached in the memo dictionary and if it is, we return the answer right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If none of these conditions are met,we progress in our recursion. For that we will iterate over the adjacency matrix to obtain the neighbors for the current node and make a recursive call for each one of them. The node would be the neighboring node and the number of stops would incremeneted by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. To each of these recursion calls, we add the weight of the corresponding edge i.e.\n",
    "- recurse(neighbor, stops + 1) + weight(node, neighbor)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. We need to return the result of recurse(src, 0) as the answer."
